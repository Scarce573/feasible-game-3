*** TO FIX ***

The format of options.txt is not very human readable and its evaluation is sloppy
- "self._game_options = eval(game_options_file.read())" is a poor way to get information
- the format of the controls is based on cureses.KEY_* and ord('*'), which is messy

Currently the game._io_move_* functions do nothing
- They just have debug prints

Game._controls is not based off of Game._state.index
- It's currently defined in Game.__init__(self)

Curses does not support key up/down as far as I can tell
- Consider looking into another I/O system

Everything State._map and below defaults to something by debug
- It's for testing renderer
